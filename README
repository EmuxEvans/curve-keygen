NAME
    curve-keygen - a utility to generate CURVE25519 keypairs.

SYNOPSIS
     Usage: curve-genkey [options]

     Options:
      -f <keyfile>    Filename for the key, default: 'id_curve25519'.
      -n <name>       Your name
      -m <mail>       Your email address
      -o <org>        Your organization
      -y              Read private key file and print public key, requires -s
      -s <secretfile> File containing a secret key
      -c              Don't encrypt the secret key (CZMQ default)
      -h              print this help message
      -v              print program version

DESCRIPTION
    curve-genkey generates a CURVE25519 keypair. It stores the public key in
    CZMQ's zcert format and the private key in binary form. If the option -c
    have been supplied or if no passphrase provided, the private key will be
    stored in zcert format as well.

LIBRARY
    A library libcsk is available which can be used from client programs to
    access encrypted private keys. Example usage:

     #include <csk.h>
     #include <czmq.h>
 
     int main() {
       size_t rawsize;
       char secretfile[] = "id_curve25519_secret";
       char passphrase[] = "my password";
       unsigned char *raw = csk_raw_load(secretfile, &rawsize);
       zcert_t *cert = csk_zcert_decrypt(raw, passphrase, rawsize);
       if(cert != NULL) {
         // do something with cert
       }
       return 0;
     }

    Compile the client program with -lcsk ld flag.

FILES
    curve-keygen creates by default files in the current directory. If not
    further specified these are:

    id_curve25519_secret
        The encrypted private key in binary form. If the private key is
        saved without encryption this file will be in CZMQ zcert format.

    id_curve25519
        The public key in CZMQ zcert format.

BUGS
    Currently curve-keygen stores the encrypted private key as raw binary
    stream to disk. This is not portable. A future version will save the key
    in IETF format or - once CZMQ provides support for it - in
    zcert-secret-format (however that might be named then).
